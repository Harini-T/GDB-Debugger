In general program bug can cause one of 2 things to happen:
	1. It can cause the program to do something that the programmer doesnt intend. ==> bugs are due to flaws in logic.
	2. It can cause the program to bomb or crash. These bugs are often associated with the mishandling or misuse of pointers
	
	
What really happens when a program crashes:
	Segmentation fault - memory access problem
	Memory Layout:	Text section, data section, bss for unintialized data, heap, stack
