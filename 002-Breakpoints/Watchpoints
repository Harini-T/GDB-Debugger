Watch is a special kind of breakpoint; an instruction that tells GDB to pause execution whenever an expression changes value.
ex:
	watch i ==> will make GDB pause whenever i changes value.
	watch (i | j > 12) && i>24 && strlen(name) >6
	
	you can watch a variable that exists and is in scope. Once the variable no longer exists in any frame of the call stack, GDB automatically deletes the watchpoint
	
	
	Hardware Watchpoints:
	Many platforms have dedicated hardware that can be used to implement a wacthpoint. GDB will try to use the hardware, if its available, because implementing anything wuth hardware is fast
	If hardware is busy, GDB implements watch points using virtual machine ==> fast
	If neither is available, GDB will implement the watchpoints itself via software ==> slow
	
	
	CPU allows limited number of hardware -assisted breakpoints/watchpoints
